In this project I challenged myself and figured out how to get the two instances from a class to interact with each other in the attack function, and I also learned how to filter out the unwanted choices from the random.choice list. I also learned the format function so I can get the desired info of my Pokemon without having to type it out word by word. My project also went beyond in a sense that making test functions for methods that builds on user input is much harder and I spent a great amount of time trying to figure that out."
